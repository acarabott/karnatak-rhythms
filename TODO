	//Structure / Themes
		-Are there themes that run throughout tanis?

	//Kannakus
		-Can only land on the Eduppu
				Even though the	important formal cadences-moras, k6rvais, etc.-must resolve at the
				eduppu, most of the sarvalaghu pattems begin and change with the
				beginnings of beats. The eduppu, then, is usually invoked during a solo only
				when something structurally significant is going on.
		//Moras
			-Do mora gaps always start with an open sound (tom, tam etc);
		//Korvais
			-Find examples and structures

		Kona Word TODO
		-Printing output to be useful to ethnos....
		-Fundamental change! - Still do this?
			-Make is possible to supply the syllables to play,
				-The no. jatis doesn't determine the syllables
				-This makes it easier to work with open sounds or phrases like Ta - Din which is a 3 (ta ki tha);
					-Still have defaults, maybe a default for open and closed
				-Keeps T Lan g as 1234 12(3)4
			-Potential confusion... Ta 0.5 could be [0.25, (0.25)] or 0.5
				-Is this really a problem or just potential duplication?
		-Change all generations of KonaWords to include synth

		-whether a sound is open or closed
		-Method for adapting a phrase to a longer length.
			E.g. Takadimi Takajuno fills 2, need to fill 1.5 = takadimi taka		or Takadimi Takajuno fills 2, need 3. Gives takadimi taka juna taka

	/*
		KonaTime TODO
		-change all generations of konawords to include synths
		-Method that returns a portion of time in a new tala
			-Would have to call methods in sub-units, adapting to new tala
			-Would be useful as educational tool
			-May be useful if keeping a database of material, easily adapt for other talas

Structure

Synth Def Class?
		Recieves synth messages
		Takes care of whether a sound should be open or closed

TaniAvartanam Class
	args:	Tempo
			Tāḷa (+ Kālai)
			Duration
			Gati
			Gati(s) to change to
	If any args aren't supplied they are selected using weights

	Will store generated phrases for use throughout

	Defines the structure
			Vilamba Kāla
			madhyama kāla
			ending section
		Each section has it's own class?
			Or when 'entering' a new section, values in the tani class are changed.
		Section or Tani class will determine when kannakus will be used

Time Class
	Represents some time.

	args	tāḷa (kālai)

	vars		number of beats
				number of talas

KonaWord Class
	Represents one word e.g. takadimi
